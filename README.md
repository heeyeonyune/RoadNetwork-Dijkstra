# RoadNetwork-Dijkstra

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm in Java to compute the shortest path tree (SPT) from a given source node over a large-scale road network graph. It reads edge data from a file and reports detailed performance metrics, including runtime and memory usage.

## Features
- Adjacency list graph representation
- Min-heap based Dijkstra algorithm
- Input via plain-text road network files
- Reports parent and distance for each vertex
- Measures execution time and memory usage
